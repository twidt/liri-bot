# liri-bot

Overview

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. This was my first application integrating Node.js.
How it Works

LIRI takes in the following commands:

    my-tweets
    spotify-this-song
    movie-this
    do-what-it-says
